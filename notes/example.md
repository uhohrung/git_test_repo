AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.<br>

  * Type some Makrdown on the left
  * see HTML in the right
  * :star: Magic :star:

## Feautres
  * Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  * Drag and drop images(requires your Dropbox account be linked)
  * import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  * Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  * Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the fromating conventions<br>
that people naturally use in email.<br>
As [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) writes on the [Markdown site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)<br>
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(hello)
```
> ***The overriding design goal for Markdown's***<br>
> ***formatting syntax is to make it as readable***<br>
> ***as possible. The idea is that a***<br>
> ***Markdown-formatted document should be***<br>
> ***publishable as-is, as plain text, without***<br>
> ***looking like it's been marked up with tags***<br>
> ***or formatting instructions.***<br>

This text yu see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel<br>
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and<br>
watch the results in the right.
